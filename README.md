# strength-track

The code in this repo includes just a few utilities that might be useful in
tracking strength and weight data emitted by
[SimpleWorkoutLog](https://www.simpleworkoutlog.com/).

## `load-workoutlog.R`
`load-workoutlog.R`
autoloads data (from hardcoded locations) and generates
some ggplot2 based plots.
It also generates some helpful summary tables in `data.table`.
Included are some functions for calculating 1RM from set performance by a
few different methods:

* Brzycki
* Epley
* Lander

## `trim.sh`
`trim.sh`
is a teeny tiny script based on GNU `cut`, which is meant to turn
the sloppy CSV files generated by the app into properly formatted CSV files
that R `data.table` can handle.
Intended usage: `cat strength.csv | bash trim.sh > strength_mod.csv`.
The only reason is exists is so that I don't have to bother to look inside
the file every time to see how many fields I need to `cut`.
Naturally, this only works on UNIX-like; if you aren't on a UNIX-like
system, you are on your own (GL).
